Implementation

Tiny : (100 * 128 = 12.8K)
16B to 128B

Small : (64K * 100 = 6.4M)
128B to 64k

Malloc algorithm :
 - find a free chunk in appropriate bin
 - coalesce chunks, starting from first free chunk, stop when a chunk is big enough
 - split top chunk
 - if top chunk was NULL or not big enough, use previous arena
 - if no previous arena, allocate new arena
 - if failed, return NULL
