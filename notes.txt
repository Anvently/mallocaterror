Implementation

Tiny : (100 * 128 = 12.8K)
16B to 128B

Small : (64K * 100 = 6.4M)
128B to 64k

Malloc algorithm :
 - find a free chunk in appropriate bin
 - coalesce chunks, starting from first free chunk in lower bin,
 	stop when a chunk is big enough or when iteration number reach a limit
 - split a chunk in the next bin ?
 - split top chunk
 - if top chunk was NULL or not big enough, use previous arena
 - if no previous arena, allocate new arena
 - if failed, return NULL

Free algorithm :
 - mark the chunk as free
 - append the chunk to bins
 

Realloc algorithm :
 - Check if the chunk is big enough
 - Check for available following chunks
 - Call free
 - Call malloc
